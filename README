For this assignment, I created a class to specifically handle object descriptions, object.cpp
and object.h. Afterwards, I modified npc and monster to handle the extra information that's
held within monster_description. I then created factory methods within descriptions.cpp for
both objects and descriptions. Within those factories, I check to make sure the randomly
selected item is within the randomly generated rarity and not an artifact already
generated (for objects) or not already in the dungeon and unique (monster). It then places
the object or monster and then returns a pointer to an instance of the object or monster
to the gen_monsters() in npc or create_objects() in object. After that, it was mostly changing
io.cpp to display the items as well as colors of the objects and monsters as well as a few
small changes to rlg327, specifically where memset was in order to deal with the descriptions
and new vectors I added. In dungeon, I added new object and monster vectors to hold the identities
of monsters and objects that should not be regenerated.
