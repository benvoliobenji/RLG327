For this assignment, I added two vectors for pc to deal with the inventory and the equipment.
When I constructed the PC, I filled the vectors with NULL object pointers to set the size of
the vectors since those shouldn't change. I decided to use vectors over arrays this time
because I could use the .size() method instead of having ints all over the place. Outside of
that I added the methods to pick up, put on, take off, drop, and delete items in the inventory
and equipment. I also changed io in order to display menus for all of the different options.
Each option for wear, take off, etc. brings up its own menu and doesn't run off of displaying
the inventory or the equipment menu. The only thing I warn is that the display doesn't fully
revert after looking at a monster description and not fully backing out of the cursor mode. It
works just fine, it's just how the dungeon is being rendered after deleting the window that
the description is printed on. The final touch ups I did was changing how the combat system works
so that the NPC's don't fight and they deal damage based on differences in dice rolls to the
PC. The PC also uses his/her's equiped objects to modify their damage output. Finally, I
changed the win conditions for each side.
