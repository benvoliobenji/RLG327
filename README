This assignment comes with two parts that are both intertwined. The first part was an idea
I had when we were given the opprotunity to choose our own projects. I saw that there wasn't
much incentive to travel up and down stairs, as well as little to risk vs. reward in the game.
So, to alleviate those concerns, I created a new character, Dave. A group of explorers went
into the dungeon before you, a group of Daves that were seeking out a beautiful treasure in
the depths of the dungeon. They discovered the treasure, but the boss of the dungeon kidnapped
all of the Daves and implanted explosives within thier bodies. You must now rescue the Daves
from the dungeon by walking over them, adding them to your band of Daves. If you make it to
the stairs and ascend/descend the stairs, you will have freed the Daves from their prison,
and in their joy, they give you the gold that they acquired. The risk with recruiting Daves
is that if they die, they set off a massive explosion, damaging everyone in a 2 block radius.
The second portion of the assignment was to implement a store, which is extremely
straightforward. Using the rewards for getting Daves to safety, you can spend it at the store
to get items without picking them up off of the dungeon floor.
