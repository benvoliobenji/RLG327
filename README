For this assignment, I moved to the professor's code to speed up testing.
Converting to c++ wasn't too terrible for most of the code. I mainly needed
to encapsulate the old header files into an extern C portion. Outside of that,
I set up character, pc, and npc to be classes where pc and npc inherit from
character. I created accessor and modifier methods to the classes, but since
I set all the variable to public, there was no real reason to create those
methods in the first place. For the fog of war, I created an array within
the pc class called memory, which would hold what the pc sees and remembers.
When the player presses f, it determines which map to use by incrementing by one
and modulo 2. For the teleport, I changed the symbol of the pc to be the debug
symbol. When the player moves, its the same as normal movement, it just doesn't
place the player back into the heap and process the other moves. For random, I
just used the method already created in the professor's code. Every time the
pc moves I call update_memory() which will update the memory map in the pc. When
a new dungeon is created, I call reset_memory() to wipe the memory of the old 
dungeon from the pc's mind.
